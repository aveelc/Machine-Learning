When we talk about describing the business problem, the first
and the most important thing is to get to know the problem, what is 
asked to do and sketch the approximate solution of it. So we worked with 
unlabeled data and clustering models.

2.
The main goal in finding an approach, is to start looking for any solution
and then work on simplifying it. Personally I spent fair amount of time
looking for datasets understanding them, then to use them easily and
properly. So I found the dataset about the Stock Data and started working
on it. I also tried to visualise dataset with help of t-SNE dimensions and step
by step doing the given tasks.

Talking about evidence, the easiest answer, that I can give is, that
looking at results and plotted clusters it all looks fine, but I am not
the judge for this case. :)

For sure I can say, it was not an easy task to do and describing
the results will be tough for me. I needed more than 6-8 hours of working
on it, as it was said in the lab description. I had some difficulties with
pipelines, some of those fails were due to my rookie mistakes :). But still it was
quite interesting, working with datasets and clusters was really fun. So I hope the
results are fine.
